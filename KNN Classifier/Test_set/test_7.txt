Merck has a promising drug pipeline for the first time in several years. It is looking to take a collaborative approach, as an expected decline in operating profit this year forces it to find new ways to finance pharmaceutical development.

Luciano Rossetti, its drug research and development chief, told Reuters the company was engaged in “very intense ongoing conversations” over deals to help fund trials of drugs in its pipeline.

He said Merck was looking to strike agreements for treatments including oral lung cancer drug tepotinib as well as a so-called bifunctional fusion protein at an earlier stage of development, which aims to assist the immune system in fighting cancer cells.

Merck did not disclose the names of potential partners.

Rossetti said the company was preparing to present initial Phase 2 trial data for tepotinib at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago in June which he expected would show the drug blocks a genetic mutation that drives tumor growth in certain lung cancer cases.

“What we expect from this high-precision approach is to have a high response rate in this patient population,” said Rossetti, adding that ASCO had the final word over whether the findings could be presented at the conference.

Bernstein analysts said in a March 21 note that tepotinib was the “one to watch” among Merck’s early and mid-stage pipeline drugs, and predicted 2030 sales of 530 million euros ($650 million).

Licence partnership agreements, which typically see a drugmaker share the cost of trials with another pharma or biotech firm in return for a share of future sales, offer Merck a way to drive through a promising drug pipeline in as many disease types as possible.

However such deals are double-edged; while they curb risk, they also curb earnings.

Merck, a diversified company that also has chemicals and lab equipment divisions, does not have the financial firepower in pharmaceuticals of the sector’s biggest players, including Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Sanofi. This could prevent it challenging larger rivals in acquiring assets in a consolidating global market, analysts say.

Pharma majors often buy certain rights to experimental drugs from rivals or smaller biotech firms to bolster their pipeline. Selling rights, so-called outlicensing, is also common but is mainly driven by a desire to win partners in unfamiliar markets rather than financial constraints.

Merck’s bifunctional fusion protein, which combines its approved cancer drug Bavencio’s immunotherapy mechanism with a second immune trigger, is in Phase 1 trials. Drugs typically go through three phases of testing before a market launch, but in cancer can be cut short to two when regulators see sufficient promise.
